This repo contains short, little scripts that I use on my day to day.

## Contents

### add_thumb
Attaches jpg files to mp4 files as cover images using ffmpeg.

### essentials
Opens websites and files that I use when looking for jobs.

### lisyou
This script reads the content of the directory,
and formats the names of the files into csv.

The goal is to get a list of files downloaded from Youtube
into a format easily copied into a spreadsheet.

The final fields will be:
<channel>;<title>;<file extension>

### listfiles
I wrote this short script to quickly dump all the
free Springer books (freed during COVID19 pandemia)
into my 'Mediateca' database.

This script reads the content of the directory;
for each directory, lists the files in it,
modifies the listing to the format I use to
register books in my 'Mediateca' database,
writes the formatted list in a text file,
and continues with the next directory.

### mapit
This one is copied from 'Automate the Boring Stuff' by Al Sweigart.
Opens Google Maps
$ mapit [address]
The address can be stored in the clipboard.

### pblog
Uses pandoc to transform a Markdown document
into an html document.

### README

### sincroniza_stick
Syncs UOC-master's documents between USB pendrive and my laptops.

### t25
Timer with music alarm.

### zip_comic

to independent zip files.
